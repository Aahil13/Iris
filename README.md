## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - css framework

### What I learned

```html
<h1
  class="text-2xl md:text-6xl mb-6 uppercase tracking-widest font-Fraunces font-[900] py-4"
>
  We are creatives
</h1>
```

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Continued development

In this project, I started my journey on knowing and mastering tailwind css. I would love to keep experimenting with it.

### Useful resources

- [Responsitivity](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) - This helped me responsive design in tailwind. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Traversy media tailwind crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ) - This helped me get a quick start in using the framework from installation to complete usage.
